I've been meaning to start blogging my adventures in Sitecore for as long as I can remember, and having just returned from SUGCON 2017 this seems like as good a time as any.

I attended the two-day conference with a couple of friend / colleagues from the my agency - Mando. With the number of breakout sessions on offer, we adopted a "divide and conquer" mentality to attend as many individual talks as we could.

Below are some of the notes and ideas I took away from the individual sessions.

## Robot

Robie the robit - looking forward to seeing more.

Personalisation based on emotion - fascinating and showcases just how powerful the xDb is. Will be intereting to see what sort of ethical issues this raises. Remember Facebook controversy.

## Helix Practically

X from uCommerce.

I'd have liked to have seen a bit more of a walkthrough and explanation of their approach to Helix - as X clearly had a few issues with the structure of the Habitat reference project. However uCommerce have put their accellerator up on github at XXXX. I'm looking forward to checking it out and seeing if it is a bit more pragmatic than the Habitat layout.

## Helix Fast Track

Anders Laub is a .... advocate of Helix and Habitat so I was quite looking forward to this talk. 

Unfortunately I had to duck out of the conference around half way through (agency life never sleeps) so look forward to seeing the rest of the slides.

## Publishing Service 2.0

The Sitecore publishing serivce is long-overdue a bit of an upgrade, as it is quite primitive compared to other enterprise CMS systems, particularly in the lack of feedback given to CMS users. This, compounded by the general slowness of the publishing service tends to be the biggest cause of support requests on Sitecore solutions as clients retry publishing operations flooding the queue further until the whole thing grinds to a half.

The publishing UI changes alone would make this a big improvement but the team have also taken steps to improve every aspect of the publishing services performnace. On sites with multiple languages publishing can be painful, but the performance statistics provided are hugely impressive as can be seen below:

The publishing service will one day be part of the core Sitecore product, once all the edge-cases have been ironed out. Until then is is a custom module but also totally free - it can be hosted on a separate server / container at no extra cost. As the footprint of the service is so small (approx 400k) there shouldn't be issues running it on a CM server, or even the database server, close to the source.

## Things I wish I'd Documented in Glass

Glass is awesome.

Am going to take another look at fluent delegate mapping. 

## Devops with Helix

Yeoman generators = awesome
Docker container deployed in 40 mins!

## Sitecore MVC Developers journey

Propeller MVC.
Will be interesting to see how it sits in a space dominated by the ubiquitous Glass Mapper.
